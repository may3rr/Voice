# Voice
Voice is an open-source speech-to-text input system designed to enable hands-free text input through real-time voice recognition.  The goal of this project is to explore transparent, reproducible, and extensible approaches to speech-based input, with a focus on clean implementation, modular design, and responsible open-source practices.
